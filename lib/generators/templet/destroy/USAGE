Description:
    Entirely removes the framework and nearly all of the generated code.
    (It doesn't delete the generated controllers - you must do this yourself.)
    The option, --pretend (-p) will show what files will be deleted,
    without carrying out the actual erasure.
    For safety, if it's called without any options it'll delete nothing.

Examples:
    # To get rid of the whole lot
    rails generate templet:destroy --all

    # To delete just the templet core tests - leaves everything else intact
    rails generate templet:destroy --only-core-rspec

    # To remove just the framework - perhaps before applying a future update!
    rails generate templet:destroy --rm-core

    # To get rid of all the application's viewer files
    rails generate templet:destroy --rm-app
