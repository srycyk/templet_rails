Description:
    This generator creates a new application area, and is to be run just once.
    It creates the directory tree, app/helpers/app/,
    which is where your own (application) code goes underneath.
    The option --include-core-specs (default: false) adds starter tests that
    check the HTML in the supplied view layouts.

Example:
    rails generate templet:install --include-layout-specs

    This will create:
        app/helpers/app.rb         # For global settings in your own code
        app/helpers/app/**         # Your own (application) code
        spec/support/apis/*        # For testing JSON sent from the controller
        spec/support/templet/*     # For testing the HTML in the rendered views
        spec/helpers/app/layouts/  # For testing layouts - if requested
