Description:
    This generator creates new application area, and is to be run just once.
    It creates the directory tree, app/helpers/app/,
    which is where your own (application) code should go underneath.

Example:
    rails generate templet:install

    This will create:
        app/helpers/app.rb         # For global settings in your own code
        app/helpers/app/**         # Your own (application) code
        spec/support/apis/*        # For testing JSON sent from the controller
        spec/support/templet/*     # For testing the HTML in the rendered views
