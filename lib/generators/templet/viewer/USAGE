Description:
    Generates a single Viewer subclass, which is called by the controller
    to actually render the view. In this class you may add your own
    modifications that alter the default behaviour.

Example:
    rails generate templet:viewer user --child kid --actions index show

    This will create:
        app/helpers/app/user_viewer.rb
