Description:
    Creates a REST controller that calls a Viewer class to render a view.
    If the PARENT option is valued then it creates a nested controller
    with the given PARENT as the (inner) model.
    If the MODEL option is given then it becomes the model name in the controller
    - otherwise the model's name is inferred from the controller's name.
    Controllers can be namespaced - but the corresponding model won't be.

Example:
    rails generate templet:controller admin/user --parent group --model person --grand-parent sector --actions index show new create destroy

    This will create:
        app/controllers/admin/users_controller.rb
