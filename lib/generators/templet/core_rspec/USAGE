Description:
    Generates Rspec tests for two sections of the core code.
    First, tests to check the HTML in the view layouts.
    Second, an optional step that adds various tests for the framework itself.
    This second step is superfluous unless you're going to change the source
    code - as these tests offer few, if any, real safeguards.
    Note that the framework tests (second step) will only be installed if
    the option, --include-core-specs is given, and also if the core is kept
    in its default directory, i.e. under app/helpers/templet/.

Example:
    rails generate template:core_rspec --include-core-specs

    This will create files under the directories:
        spec/helpers/app/panel/  # For testing layouts
        spec/helpers/templet/    # If --include-core-specs is given
