Description:
    Generates Rspec tests for the core code.
    It is superfluous unless you're going to change the source
    code - as these tests offer few, if any, real safeguards.
    Note that the tests will only be installed if the core is kept
    in its default directory, i.e. under app/helpers/templet/.

Example:
    rails generate template:core_rspec --include-core-specs

    This will create files under the directories:
        spec/helpers/templet/
        spec/suppoert/templet/
